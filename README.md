This is a Google Places Autocompelte Material UI project bootstrapped with [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

Library used to fetch places from google - [`use-places-autocomplete`](https://github.com/wellyshen/use-places-autocomplete).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

## API KEY

[`Enable Places API`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places) in your google cloud project.

[`Setup Google cloud project`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup) if you don't have one.

Then, replace the `API_KEY` in the script inside index.html file with your `API KEY` generated in the google cloud dashboard.

The `src/PlacesAutocomplete` component is the one that uses the `use-places-autocomplete`.
